During our last semester, the digital consulting company Alkemy challenged us with a data-driven business case regarding an e-commerce.
1. We performed an exploratory data analysis using SQL and PySpark on the huge database we had. Main findings were related to outlier detection, spotting trends in sales, inferring missing data we had thanks to complex joins.
2. Leader and Follower detection: we performed the Pearson's Correlation and Granger Casuality, trying to spots the sellers who changed their prices after a change in prices of others. We had no clue about strategies in price changes: the amount of change, if by an absolute amount, a percentual amount or after a certain timelag. However, we've been able to detect sellers whose managements were in contact to each other.
3. Price strategies detection: both usi
3. Detect seasonality of sales and compare popularity of products vs. their profitability: detection of best-sellers thanks to naive popularity index and provide a business framework to enhance performances
